Use a 2d array to create a playlist system for 10 artists with 10 songs each. 

Your algorithm will create a random order for the songs, 
with the bands having a minimum distance of 2 songs. i.e. you can't play the same band again until 2 songs have passed. 
(You do not have to play EVERY song in the system, just 20 is enough.)
